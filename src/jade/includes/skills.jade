      h3 HTML
      p I strive to produce semantic, minimalist and standards compliant markup where I'm able. In addition I've had extensive experience working to high accessibility standards, and have a good knowledge of localisation issues gained largely from my time at the BBC World Service.
      p Beyond simply coding markup, I've worked with a variety of templating systems and CMS theme engines to integrate my code into production environments.
