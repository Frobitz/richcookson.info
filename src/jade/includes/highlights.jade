      h3 University of Sussex (2016-2017)

      p Hired to implement a staged redesign of the University's web site, I was responsible for all front end development. I optimised the existing Foundation based code to be as streamlined as possible and reworked key areas of the site to feature the new design and improve performance and responsiveness.
      p Work is still ongoing as budget allows, but you can see my work on several areas of the site, including the <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk">home page</a>

      p As the projects front end team lead at The Team I had to liaise with counterparts at English Heritage and direct workflow within the small team of developers I was responsible for, providing  templates for the CMS team to integrate into the site.
      p This was a challenging project due to strict deadlines enforced by the organisations division, but went on to win a <a href="http://uxukawards.com/2015winners.php#awards_bee">UXUK Award</a>.

This was an interesting role as I had to investigate and determine the best way to handle their requirement for the site to use HTML5 at a time when it was relatively unusual for such a major company to do so.
