      h3 English Heritage (2015)
    
      p Working with The Team to aid English Heritage in the creation of front end code ready for their division into two organisations, English Heritage and Historic England.
      p As the projects front end team lead at The Team I had to liaise with counterparts at English Heritage and direct workflow within the small team of developers I was responsible for, providing  templates for the CMS team to integrate into the site.
      p This was a challenging project due to strict deadlines enforced by the organisations division, but went on to win a <a href="http://uxukawards.com/2015winners.php#awards_bee">UXUK Award</a>.

      h3 HSBC HTML5 Redesign Project (2010)
      
      p I was hired by Sapient to lead a team of developers producing HTML5 templates for a rebrand of the <a href="http://www.HSBC.ae">HSBC.ae</a> website which was carried out by internal CMS developers. This was an interesting role as I had to investigate and determine the best way to handle their requirement for the site to use HTML5 at a time when it was relatively unusual for such a major company to do so.
